											<h2>About me<br /></h2>
										</header>
										<p> Hi, my name is Sébastien Lozano-Forero and be very welcome to my webpage. I hold a Bachelor's degree in science (Mathematics), a Master's degree in data (Statistics) and I'm passionate about understanding and solving complex problems.<br />
										</p> 	<p>
										Since young, always enjoyed learning. So, that’s how I look at data science: an ongoing (and probably never ending) learning project with amazing oportunities to understand business questions, apply the scientific method, delivering data related products and thus, adding value to organizations who trust data.<br />
										</p> 	<p>
										Over <b>8 years</b> of experience in consulting data related problems, teaching, researching and management. Basic French (working on it),  fluent in english, spanish and portuguese. Analytic and strategical thinker, Higly addaptable, quick and passionate learner, result-and-detail-oriented individual and experienced in collaborative and individual frameworks.
										</p> 	<p>
										In this page some of my skills to solve problems using data are presented. In addition to the Data Science Portfolio, areas of interest, professional experience, education and selected publications.<br />
										</p> 	<p>
										Contact information is available at the end of the webpage.<br/>

										<h2>Areas of interest</h2>

									</header>

								<p> As my fondness for learning only grows with time, I'm looking forward to expand my areas of expertise including, but not limited to, the following: <br/>
								</header>
								<dl>

									<dt>Data Science </dt>
									<dd>
										<p> As a mathematician, I'm passionate about the uses of scientific and quantitative thinking to understand and solve complex problems. As a statistician, I'm passionate about data and the ways to uncover the various histories it tells. As a self-taught programmer, I acknowledge the world now belongs to those who can code it. Data Science is the perfect environmet to fully explore these three elements.</p>
									</dd>
									<dt>Machine Learning and Deep Learning </dt>
									<dd>
										<p> Today's world is undoubtedly shaped by data and the value we can extract from it. Never before in human history, a so vast amount of information was available to explore. The incredible ideas behind algorithms and models widely used nowdays do not cease to amaze me and wanting me to be there while being able to deliver added value to organizations and people out of its use.  </p>
									</dd>
									<dt>Data Engineering </dt>
									<dd>
										<p> From a technical perspective, data is everywhere and thus, many oportunities for integrating technologies to gather such data are available. I found particularly interesting the ideas behind modern data engineering. </p>
									</dd>
									<dt>Teaching </dt>
									<dd>
									<p> As Richard Feynman once said 'If you really want to master something, teach it'. Teaching delivers two huge outcomes: i) long lasting well being to people who learn and ii) systematic thinking and deep understanding to people who teach. Teaching is basically learning twice.</p>
									</dd>
									<dt>Music </dt>
									<dd>
									<p> Music has been and probably forever will be my main hobbie. Over 20 years of guitar playing.  </p>
									</dd>

											<h3> Dissecting and forecasting food inflation (Colombian case)</h3>

											<p> This project aimed to propose a suitable approach based on classic statistics to better forecast food inflation in Colombia based on prices collected diretly from food marketplaces across the country. Being able to proactively anticipate food prices variation lead to better decision making by authorities and food merchants. It involves heavy data wranling and processing, classical univariate and multivariate time Series models (SARIMA, SVAR and SVEC). All programming was carried out in R. </p>
